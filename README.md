# Game Graphics Programming - Starter Code #

## About the Project ##

This repository contains code created as a part of Foundations of Game Graphics Programming ([IGME 540](https://www.rit.edu/gccis/igm/)), offered by [Professor Chris Cascioli](https://www.rit.edu/gccis/igm/christopher-cascioli) at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu).

Students were provided with basic DirectX 11 functionality, including initial versions of the following classes:

- `DXCore` class

- `Game` class

- `Main` class

- `SimpleShader` class

The project also included basic vertex and fragment/pixel shaders for basic functionality:

- `VertexShader.hlsl`

- `PixelShader.hlsl`

Throughout the semester, students were assigned different sections of the code to rewrite, refactor, revise, or build upon and expand.

> Students will explore the use of an advanced graphics API to access hardware-accelerated graphics in a real-time graphics engine context.  The course will involve discussion of scene graphs, optimizations, and integration with the API object structure, as well as input schemes, content pipelines, and 2D and 3D rendering techniques.  Students will also explore the advanced use of the API calls in production code to construct environments capable of real-time performance.  Students will construct from scratch a fully functional graphics engine, with library construction for game development.

## Assignment 2 - Meshes ##

This branch contains the work for [Assignment 2: Meshes](https://mycourses.rit.edu/d2l/le/content/736702/viewContent/5582570/View) (link requires access to MyCourses).

### Overview ###

[x] **Mesh class** to hold geometry data (vertices & indices) in DirectX buffers.

[x] **Three Mesh objects**, with different geometry, in the Game Class.

[x] Meshes can be **drawn** to the screen.

[x] No **memory leaks** and **DirectX resources released** properly.

[x] No **warnings**.
